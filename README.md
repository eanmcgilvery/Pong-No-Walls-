# Pong No Walls! - Java Edition

This project is a game made made to recreate pong with a twist!

Traditionally pong has two paddles and one ball, where the objective is to bounce the 
ball behing the opponents paddle to score a point. However in this variation all walls
are removed and replaced with horizontal facing paddles. Therefore the player has 6 paddles 
to control: 2 Horizontal, 1 vertical.

The player faces off against a computer in which they can choose the difficulty of
easy, medium, or insane.

Implemented using the Graphics and JFrame library included in Java.
